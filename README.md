EucliDraw is a Python-based educational tool that brings 2D Euclidean geometry to life through intuitive shape visualization. Using the built-in turtle graphics module, users can input the name of a polygon (e.g., triangle, square, hexagon), and the program draws it while displaying its geometric properties.

🎯 Features
🟢 Interactive user input to choose shapes by name

🟢 Built-in library of polygons with customizable side lengths

🟢 Dynamic visualization using Python's turtle module

🟢 Easy to extend with new shapes and styles

🟢 Beginner-friendly code — ideal for learning Python and geometry together

🧮 Supported Shapes
Triangle

Square

Pentagon

Hexagon

Octagon

…and more!
